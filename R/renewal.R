#' Parliamentary Renewal
#'
#' `renewal` calculates parliamentary renewal rates
#'
#' @param seats (\code{numeric}). Number of legislative seats in dispute
#' @param dropout (\code{numeric}). Number of parliamentarians who gave up the legislative career and vacancy for various reasons
#' @param defeated (\code{numeric}). Number of defeated parliamentarians
#' @param reelected (\code{numeric}). Number of re-elected parliamentarians
#'
#' @param type (\code{character}). type of renewal to be calculated. by default it is \code{"all"}.
#' But only one renewal can be chosen: \code{"grr"} (gross renewal rate), \code{"crr"} (compulsory renewal rate), \code{"nrr"} (net renewal rate).
#'
#' @return
#'
#' A percentage which is the Renewal Rate. See parameter type.
