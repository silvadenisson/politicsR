\usage{
lh(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{numeric}). Numeric vector with the vote share of parties}

\item{y}{(\code{numeric}). Numeric vector with the seat share of parties}
}
\value{
If the input is a proportion the result is between 0 and 1.
  But if the input is a percentage it is between 0 and 100.
  In both cases the higher the value, the more disproportional the electoral system is.
}
\description{
`lh()` calculates the electoral disproportionality between votes and
seats as proposed by Loosemore and Hanby (1971).
}
\examples{

votes <- c(0.2, 0.2, 0.6)
seats <- c(0.18, 0.17, 0.65)
lh(votes, seats)
